This example is not yet integrated into the lecture notes.

I wrote it to demonstrate:
- basic abstract type, strbuffer_t, to mimic Java's StringBuffer
- basic demostration of its use to handle line-oriented input
  - possible future extension is to have an absolute upper bound on memory usage
- demonstration of GNU regex to process words
